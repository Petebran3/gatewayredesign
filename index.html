    <h2>Why New York</h2>
    <article>
        <p>I chose New York, because it's one of the top cities I want to visit one day. I always hear so many great things about the city that never sleeps and I also have a friend that plays for the Buffalo Bills, so hopefully in October I'll be there.

The Empire State, The Concrete Jungle, The Big Apple, The City That Never Sleeps, and last but not least, for all my DC fans Gotham. These are the many nicknames that describe one of the most visted cities in the world.
